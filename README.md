# Final_Project_GunnFight
Project IDEA

In this project, I am going to create a simple game using core java concepts and OOP.
This game is not going to have an interface or UI. This is just for learning purposes
about how we use the concepts of java and OOP in real world programming and software development.

So for this game, first I am going to create two players named player 1 and player 2.
They both will have some common properties. The common properties will be such as Name, Weapon and Health.
But player 2 will have another option to wear armour or not. Then we will have two guns as Gun 1 and Gun 2. 
If Player 1 is wounded by a gun 1 his health will be damaged by 30% and if hit by gun 2,
his health will be damaged by 50%. But in case of player 2, if his armour is on(true),
his health will be damaged by 20% and if hit by gun 2, his health will be damaged by
40% because the armour is on. And if health == 0, then the players will be dead.

We are going to have another method called Heal. so if a player presses the heal
option his Health will again reach to its maximum level which is 100%.
And this is the simple game I am going to create in my first java project using the basic and core concepts of JAVA and OOP.
